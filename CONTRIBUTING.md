# Contributing to Braze Docs 

Welcome to our repo! We'd like to set you up for success, so here are some resources to get you going! 

Check out our [Contributor Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/Appboy/braze-docs/wiki/Contributor-Quick-Start-Guide) to start making changes without all the mumbo-jumbo!

Actually, you should sign [our CLA](https://www.braze.com/docs/cla/) first. And possibly take a look at our [Writing](https://github.com/Appboy/braze-docs/wiki/Writing-Style-Guide-&-Best-Practices), [Media](https://github.com/Appboy/braze-docs/wiki/Media-Formatting-Guide), and [Special Feature](https://github.com/Appboy/braze-docs/wiki/Special-Formatting) formatting guides...

If you're into using mumbo-jumbo to make changes, you can [set Up Your Local Environment](https://github.com/Appboy/braze-docs/wiki/Set-Up-Your-Local-Environment) and use a text editor and a terminal. 

Please be sure to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Appboy/braze-docs/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in all of your actions here!
